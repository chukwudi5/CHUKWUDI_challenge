#Description: Creating a scalable and static web application in AWS

#Author: Chukwudi Stanley Onwumelu

#Date: 2/17/2019

Please find below a walk through or steps taken to build the Web application

1. An AWS instance was created, and the following ports (HTTP, HTTPS, SSH and CUSTOM TCP RULE 8084) were enabled.

2. On the AWS instance; an update was made on the instance using 
#yum update -y

3. Apache was installed on it using the command #yum install httpd -y 

4. Since the ports in the security group were enabled alread, i ran the command #vi index.html so that i can input the code that was presented to me in the code challenge

5. So i inputted the ip address of the aws instance on a browser to confirm my created webserver.
